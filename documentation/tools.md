# Tools

The `tools/` directory contains operational helpers for imports, indexing, searches, and diagnostics.
Run tools from the repository root unless noted otherwise.

Most Python tools expect the project virtual environment:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/<script>.py ...
```

## Configuration

Several tools read `tools/config.yaml`.
Start from the sample:

```bash
cp tools/config.yaml.sample tools/config.yaml
```

Important settings:

- `IN_MEILI_URL`, `IN_MEILI_API_KEY`, `INDEX_NAME`: Meilisearch input index
- `OUT_MEILI_URL`, `OUT_MEILI_API_KEY`, `INDEX_NAME`: Meilisearch output index
- `IN_KVROCKS_HOST`, `IN_KVROCKS_PORT`: Kvrocks index used by imports/search dumps
- `OUT_KVROCKS_HOST`, `OUT_KVROCKS_PORT`: Kvrocks output used by some export helpers
- `PLUMISLAND`, `PLUMAPIUSER`, `PLUMAPIPWD`: API access for webapp import helpers

## API import role

### `Feeder`

`Feeder` is the least-privilege role for automated target import tools.
Fresh installs create it automatically, and migration `17` adds it on upgraded instances.

The role only grants:

- `can_post` on `PublicTargetsApi`: required by `tools/import_whois_ranges.py`
- `can_bulk_import` on `TargetsApi`: required by `tools/import_fqdns.py`

Use a dedicated Plum user with only the `Feeder` role for automated imports.
Do not reuse an admin account in tool configuration files.

## Tag tools

### `initial_setup.py`

Load initial database content after the Flask database has been created.
`setup.sh` calls this script automatically after `flask fab create-admin`.

It performs these actions:

- create/update security roles from `webapp/security_roles/*.yaml`
- create the default TCP protocol and TCP ports
- create the default HTTP header tagging collection from `webapp/app/models.py`
- import YAML tag rules from `webapp/tags/` into the application database
- clone/update `https://github.com/D4-project/Plum-Rules-NSE` into `external/Plum-Rules-NSE` and import every `.nse` file into the `nses` table
- create an all-target `Default banner scan` profile for TCP ports 22, 80, and 443 with `banner.nse`

Manual run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/initial_setup.py
```

Useful options:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/initial_setup.py --dry-run
.venv/bin/python tools/initial_setup.py --skip-roles
.venv/bin/python tools/initial_setup.py --skip-ports
.venv/bin/python tools/initial_setup.py --skip-headers
.venv/bin/python tools/initial_setup.py --skip-tags
.venv/bin/python tools/initial_setup.py --skip-nse
.venv/bin/python tools/initial_setup.py --skip-profiles
.venv/bin/python tools/initial_setup.py --role-file webapp/security_roles/read_only.yaml
.venv/bin/python tools/initial_setup.py --nse-repo-dir /path/to/Plum-Rules-NSE
```

The default role file creates a `Read Only` role from `webapp/security_roles/read_only.yaml`.
The file is intentionally plain YAML so permissions can be maintained without editing Python code.

Imported NSE files are copied into the Flask upload folder and stored in the DB with their filename and SHA-256 hash.
If a script with the same filename already exists, it is updated only when the content hash changed.

### `tag_mgmt.py`

Manage tag YAML import, DB rules, and Kvrocks tag indexes. Running it without a subcommand prints help and does nothing.

Import YAML tag rules from `webapp/tags/` into the SQLite application database:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py import --all
```

Useful import options:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py import --all --dry-run
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py import --id 42
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py import --tags-file webapp/tags/hashicorp_vault.yaml
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py import --all --tags-dir webapp/tags
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py delete --all
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py delete --id 42
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py delete --tags-file webapp/tags/hashicorp_vault.yaml
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py flush-tag tag:proto:ssh
```

Version policy:

- new rules are inserted
- existing rules are replaced only when the YAML version is newer than the DB timestamp
- YAML rules without `version` do not replace existing DB rules

Recompute tags in Kvrocks after tag rule changes.

Reindex all active rules:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py reindex --allrules
```

Reindex from one tag rule id:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py reindex 42
```

Flush existing tag indexes before recomputing:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py reindex --allrules --flush
```

List complete tag values currently indexed in Kvrocks:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/tag_mgmt.py list-tags
```

`tools/import_tags.py` and `tools/reindex_tagrule.py` remain as compatibility wrappers.

## Search and dump tools

### `dump_object.py`

Dump distinct indexed Kvrocks values for one exact indexed field.
Output is CSV:

```text
count,value
```

Examples:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/dump_object.py http_title
.venv/bin/python tools/dump_object.py http_server
.venv/bin/python tools/dump_object.py http_cookiename
.venv/bin/python tools/dump_object.py banner
```

List dumpable fields:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/dump_object.py --list-dumpable
```

The field name must be the real indexed Kvrocks field name. No aliases are accepted.

### `kvrocks_search.py`

Developer/demo script showing how to call `KVrocksIndexer.get_uids_by_criteria()`.
It is useful as an example for exact, prefix, substring, IP, network, and port criteria.

### `test_parse.py`

Parse one Meilisearch JSON document and print the parsed structure with computed tags.

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/test_parse.py meili_dump/a/<uid>.json
```

## Indexing tools

### `dump_meilidb.py`

Export all documents from the configured Meilisearch index to `meili_dump/`.
Each document is written as one JSON file grouped by the first character of its UID.

Run from `tools/` because the script reads `config.yaml` from the current directory:

```bash
cd tools
../.venv/bin/python dump_meilidb.py
```

### `index_meili.py`

Import dumped JSON documents into the configured output Meilisearch index.

The script reads `tools/config.yaml` and writes to `OUT_MEILI_URL` / `OUT_MEILI_API_KEY`. The target index name comes from `INDEX_NAME`, defaulting to `plum`.

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/index_meili.py --input-dir tools/meili_dump
```

Batch size can be adjusted:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/index_meili.py --input-dir tools/meili_dump --batch-size 500
```

Use `--progress` when you want percentage output:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/index_meili.py --input-dir tools/meili_dump --progress
```

This counts importable JSON documents before sending anything to Meilisearch. On large dumps this makes startup slower.

### `index_kvrocks.py`

Build or rebuild the Kvrocks search indexes from Meilisearch documents.
Kvrocks stores compact reverse indexes used by structured search; Meilisearch remains the source for full scan documents.

#### Use cases

Use an incremental import from an existing dump when you already have `tools/meili_dump/` and only want to index those files:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/index_kvrocks.py --input-dir tools/meili_dump
```

This does not delete the full Kvrocks index first. Existing documents keep their stored timestamps. Reindexed UIDs are refreshed and their old per-field values are removed before new values are written. Documents that are not present in the input dump remain in Kvrocks.

Use a rebuild from a dump when you want to clean stale Kvrocks keys but prefer to work from an offline Meilisearch export:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/index_kvrocks.py --rebuild --input-dir tools/meili_dump
```

This deletes known Plum Kvrocks keys, then imports every JSON document from the dump. Before deleting `doc:*`, it snapshots existing `first_seen` and `last_seen` values in memory and applies them during reimport.

Use a rebuild directly from Meilisearch when you want the cleanest operational path and do not need an intermediate dump directory:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/index_kvrocks.py --rebuild-from-meili
```

This reads Meilisearch directly, verifies that Meilisearch returns at least one document, then deletes and rebuilds the known Kvrocks keys. It has the same timestamp preservation behavior as `--rebuild`, but avoids creating or relying on `tools/meili_dump/`.

Run a Kvrocks rebuild after changing HTTP Header Collection rules when existing scan documents need the new `http_header` or `http_headval` indexes.

Use `--retag` with either rebuild mode when tag rules must be recomputed during the rebuild:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/index_kvrocks.py --rebuild-from-meili --retag
```

Without `--retag`, rebuilds preserve existing `tag:*` and `tags:*` indexes and do not parse active Tag Rules. With `--retag`, the script cleans existing tag indexes and recomputes tags from all active Tag Rules while parsing source documents.

#### Timestamp preservation

Search time bounds (`from` / `to`) are evaluated from Kvrocks only. They depend on `doc:{uid}.first_seen`, `doc:{uid}.last_seen`, `first_seen_index`, and `last_seen_index`; Meilisearch is not used as the live source for those time filters.

`last_seen` can usually be recovered from the scan document end time in Meilisearch. `first_seen` is historical state accumulated in Kvrocks and cannot always be reconstructed from Meilisearch alone.

Without `--rebuild`, existing `doc:{uid}` timestamps are kept for UIDs already present in Kvrocks. New UIDs get timestamps from the parsed scan document.

With `--rebuild` or `--rebuild-from-meili`, the script snapshots existing `doc:{uid}` timestamps before deleting keys. During reimport, it preserves:

- earliest known `first_seen`
- latest known `last_seen`

This protects timestamps for documents that are present in the rebuild source. If a document exists only in Kvrocks and is missing from the dump or Meilisearch source, it will not be recreated after a rebuild.

For extra safety before a full clean rebuild, export `first_seen` to CSV, rebuild, then import the CSV:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/first_seen_csv.py --export first_seen.csv
.venv/bin/python tools/index_kvrocks.py --rebuild-from-meili
.venv/bin/python tools/first_seen_csv.py --import first_seen.csv
.venv/bin/python tools/dump_object.py http_title
```

The CSV restore updates `doc:{uid}.first_seen` and `first_seen_index`. It does not overwrite `last_seen`.

#### Progress and tuning

Progress lines include total document count and percentage when available:

```text
Processed 18000/123456 Meili documents (14.6%); indexed=17500/123456 (14.2%); pending_batch=500
Indexed 20000/123456 (16.2%) documents
```

For `--rebuild-from-meili`, the total comes from Meilisearch. For `--input-dir`, the total is the number of JSON files in the dump directory.

Batch size can be adjusted:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/index_kvrocks.py --batch-size 500
```

Document parsing uses multiprocessing by default with one fewer worker than the CPU count. Set `--workers 1` to disable multiprocessing:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/index_kvrocks.py --rebuild-from-meili --workers 1
```

Kvrocks writes stay in the main process. Worker processes only parse documents.

Ctrl+C is handled gracefully. The first Ctrl+C asks the tool to stop after flushing the already parsed pending batch and exits with status `130`. Press Ctrl+C a second time to force an immediate stop.

### `first_seen_csv.py`

Export and restore `first_seen` values across Kvrocks rebuilds.
This exists because `first_seen` is historical Kvrocks state and cannot be fully reparsed from Meilisearch documents.

Export from `IN_KVROCKS_HOST` / `IN_KVROCKS_PORT`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/first_seen_csv.py --export first_seen.csv
```

Import into `OUT_KVROCKS_HOST` / `OUT_KVROCKS_PORT`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/first_seen_csv.py --import first_seen.csv
```

Validate the CSV without writing:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/first_seen_csv.py --import first_seen.csv --dry-run
```

CSV columns:

```text
uid,ip,first_seen,last_seen
```

Only `uid` and `first_seen` are required for import.
The import updates `doc:{uid}.first_seen` and `first_seen_index`.
It does not overwrite `last_seen`.
The tool prints the expected total first, then progress every 1000 processed records.

### `index_meili.py`

Import JSON documents from `meili_dump/` into Meilisearch.
This is a low-level recovery helper with hardcoded connection defaults in the script.
Review the script before use.

## Target and FQDN tools

### `import_whois_ranges.py`

Download RIR WHOIS sources, find records matching configured countries or words, convert matching `inetnum` ranges to CIDR, reduce locally covered CIDRs, and import them into Plum through the API.

The tool reads `tools/range_import.yaml`.
Start from the sample:

```bash
cp tools/range_import.yaml.sample tools/range_import.yaml
chmod 600 tools/range_import.yaml
```

Example:

```yaml
base_url: "http://localhost:5000"
country:
  - "LU"
words:
  - "luxembourg"
username: "feeder-user"
password: "..."
```

Run a parse-only check:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/import_whois_ranges.py --dry-run
```

Run and import into Plum:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/import_whois_ranges.py
```

Useful options:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/import_whois_ranges.py --forcedownload
.venv/bin/python tools/import_whois_ranges.py --debug
```

Behavior and safety:

- active sources are hardcoded in the script; disabled sources are ignored
- downloads are stored under `tools/tmp/`
- cached source files older than 24 hours are downloaded again
- `--forcedownload` ignores the 24-hour cache freshness check
- compressed downloads are written atomically via `.part` files
- compressed download size is capped at 512 MiB
- gzip sources are decompressed while parsing
- country matching is case-insensitive after normalization
- `words` matching is case-insensitive and can match any line in a record
- duplicate CIDRs are removed
- CIDRs already covered by a wider CIDR in the local import set are skipped
- CIDRs are imported through the Plum API, never by direct DB writes
- `netname` is used as target description when available
- logs are written to `tools/log/import_whois_ranges.log`
- log files rotate daily and keep 14 days

Security notes:

- use a dedicated user with the `Feeder` role
- keep `tools/range_import.yaml` out of git
- keep `tools/range_import.yaml` mode `600`; the tool warns when it is too open
- `base_url` must be HTTPS unless it points to localhost/loopback

### `import_fqdns.py`

Bulk-import newline-delimited targets through the Plum Island API.
The input file can contain FQDNs, IPs, and CIDR ranges.

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/import_fqdns.py --file targets.txt
```

The tool authenticates with `PLUMISLAND`, `PLUMAPIUSER`, and `PLUMAPIPWD` from `tools/config.yaml`.
Use a dedicated Plum user with the `Feeder` role for this tool.

### `last_fqdns.py`

Extract unique FQDNs seen during the last N hours from Kvrocks.
This is useful when Plum receives passive DNS observations from a sensor and you want to resolve recently observed names.

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/last_fqdns.py --hours 24
```

Optionally resolve every FQDN:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/last_fqdns.py --hours 24 --resolve yes
```

Resolution results are logged, not printed to stdout.
With `--debug`, each successful or failed FQDN resolution is shown on the console.
FQDNs are logged at debug level, not printed.
At the end of the run, the tool logs a short summary with found, resolved, and newly created Plum FQDN target counts.

The tool reads `tools/config.yaml` and logs to `tools/log/last_fqdns.log`.
Log files rotate daily and keep 14 days.
Use `--debug` to show debug logs on the console.

Learning mode can add recently seen FQDNs back into Plum targets.
It is intended for focused learning on domains or TLDs you explicitly care about, for example a country TLD, an owned zone, or a watched customer domain.
Configure regexes in `tools/config.yaml`:

```yaml
last_fqdns_learn:
  - ".lu$"
  - "(^|\\.)example\\.com$"
```

Then run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tools/last_fqdns.py --hours 24 --learn
```

With `--learn`, all listed FQDNs are resolved.
Only FQDNs matching at least one `last_fqdns_learn` regex are imported, and only when they return at least one address.
The regexes do not limit resolution; they only decide which successfully resolved names are learned as Plum targets.
Imports use the Plum API credentials from `PLUMISLAND`, `PLUMAPIUSER`, and `PLUMAPIPWD`.
Without `--learn`, no target import is performed.

## Notes

- `tools/config.yaml` can contain credentials. Do not commit production secrets.
- `tools/q` and `tools/title` are local scratch files, not maintained CLI tools.
- Prefer `--dry-run` when available before writing to the database or indexes.
